Technology for Rural Healthcare Access
in Clearwater Ridge

Situation Overview
In January 2026, Clearwater Ridge experienced an unusually severe winter storm that
forced the closure of the only highway connecting the community to the nearest
major hospital for more than five days. During this period, residents were unable to
travel to medical appointments, including follow-ups and specialist consultations that
had already been delayed for several months due to the disorganized and incohesive
nature of the medical system in Clearwater Ridge.


One incident, in particular, drew attention across the community. An elderly resident
with a known heart condition missed a cardiology follow-up appointment due to poor
communication around rescheduling options. With no systematic way to track the
missed referral, the appointment was never rebooked. Two weeks later, the individual
was airlifted to the hospital following an avoidable medical emergency.
In the wake of this incident, community leaders and healthcare providers agreed that
it was time to fix the healthcare infrastructure of Clearwater Ridge. Although the
highway closure was the catalyst for the breakdown, the issue lied in the fact that the
current system did not have the flexibility to respond to such a disaster, leading to
immediate danger to the wellbeing of residents.
Community Overview
Clearwater Ridge is a remote northern Canadian community with a population of
approximately 1800 residents, located several hours from the nearest urban centre.
The demographic is composed of a high proportion of seniors, Indigenous families,
and seasonal workers employed in forestry and mining. Many households rely on fixed
or seasonal incomes, making affordability an ongoing concern.


Healthcare services in Clearwater Ridge are limited. The village operates one single
nursing station staffed by registered nurses, supported by two rotating family
physicians who visit the community twice per month. Residents requiring more
advanced care are required to travel to a hospital located 110 km away, primarily
accessible by a single highway.


As a result, many healthcare interactions involve referrals and services outside the
community. These referrals are currently managed through a combination of phone
calls, paper forms and basic spreadsheets, with limited ability to cohesively track
whether appointments have been scheduled, attended or followed up.
Communication between providers, patients and community support services is
often fragmented and relies heavily on manual effort.


Transportation presents another major challenge. A small network of volunteer
drivers and community vans assist residents travelling to medical appointments, but
coordination is often informal and inconsistent. Ride requests are currently handled
by phone or text message, making it difficult to manage last-minute cancellations or
conflicting plans. Missed or delayed transportation often results in missed
appointments among other complications.
Mental health support is another area of growing concern. Community leaders and
healthcare workers report increasing rates of depression, anxiety and substance
abuse, particularly within the youth and older adults. While remote mental health
services exist at the provincial level, awareness, access, and follow-up remain
inconsistent. Concerns around privacy and stigma further limit adoption of regular
support.

Problem Statement
Residents face increasing missed appointments, untreated mental health concerns,
and avoidable emergency hospitalizations. Information gaps, manual referral
tracking, and unreliable transportation coordination are just some of the many issues
created by systemic failures in care continuity. You have been hired by the Clearwater
Ridge Community Health Council to design and build a codable technical solution
that improves healthcare coordination so patients can receive the care and support
that they need.
Community Trends
Virtual Care and Hybrid Delivery is becoming baseline
Across Canada, healthcare delivery is increasingly shifting toward virtual
appointments and hybrid care models, especially for rural and northern regions
where specialist access is limited and travel is expensive, unreliable, or seasonally
unsafe. In fact, virtual visits accounted for ~33% of all patient-reported healthcare
visits in Canada between January 2021 and March 2022, showing that virtual care is
now a core part of the healthcare system rather than a temporary workaround.
During this period, virtual care represented 38% of family doctor visits and 27% of
specialist visits, highlighting its role in both primary care and specialty follow-ups.
For Clearwater Ridge, this trend is especially critical because winter storms and
highway shutdowns can cut the community off from external services for extended
periods, meaning the community needs tools that can support follow-ups, check-ins,
and specialist continuity even when travel becomes impossible.

Care Coordination Is the Primary Failure Point in Rural
Health Systems

Healthcare outcomes in rural regions are increasingly shaped not only by staffing
shortages, but by breakdowns in coordination, especially when referrals,
appointments, and follow-ups are tracked manually. Nationally, delayed or incomplete
referrals remain a serious challenge, with wait times for specialist referrals averaging
approximately 30.0 weeks across Canada, and longer delays often occurring in
northern communities. As a result, health systems are investing in tools that ensure
continuity of care by connecting referrals, appointment status updates, missed visit
tracking, and automated follow-up workflows. Clearwater Ridge mirrors this issue
directly because the community currently relies on phone calls, paper forms, and
spreadsheets, making it easy for missed appointments to go untracked or unresolved.
Closed-loop care models are becoming standard practice, meaning every referral
should be resolved through completion, rescheduling, or escalation rather than being
lost in the system.

Transportation Is Being Treated as Healthcare Infrastructure


In rural healthcare, transportation is increasingly treated as a core determinant of
health access rather than a separate logistics issue, because access to care often
depends on physically reaching diagnostic tests, specialist appointments, and hospital
services. Many rural regions are now using tools that centralize ride requests, reduce
scheduling conflicts, handle cancellations, and prioritize urgent medical travel, since
unreliable transport directly increases missed appointments and worsens outcomes.
Clearwater Ridge faces this challenge clearly: ride coordination is informal and
inconsistent, and requests occur via scattered calls and texts, making it difficult to
manage timing changes, no-shows, or conflicting plans. With the nearest hospital
located 110 km away, a single missed ride can translate into a missed referral, delayed
treatment, or preventable escalation. A healthcare coordination solution that includes
transportation planning as a built-in component will better reflect modern rural
health system design and will produce a direct impact on appointment attendance
and continuity.
Preventable Emergencies Are Driving System Reform and
Funding



Healthcare reform and funding are increasingly focused on reducing avoidable
emergency department visits and preventable escalations, since these events drive
high costs and worsen patient outcomes. Across Canada, 15% of emergency
department visits between April 2023 and March 2024 were for conditions that could
potentially have been managed in primary care, highlighting the scale of avoidable
escalation when access and continuity break down. At the same time, hospital care
remains expensive, with CIHI’s Cost of a Standard Hospital Stay ranging roughly from
$5,000 to $15,000 among teaching hospitals depending on specialty and case mix,
reinforcing the value of prevention and follow-up continuity. This has led to a shift
toward early-warning models such as risk flagging, missed appointment triggers, and
proactive outreach protocols to ensure patients receive timely follow-up before their
conditions worsen.
Clearwater Ridge’s cardiology incident reflects this pattern, since a missed follow-up
was not tracked, no rescheduling workflow existed, and the breakdown ultimately
led to an avoidable emergency escalation.
Mental Health Support Is Shifting Toward Privacy-First Access
and Follow-Up

Mental health needs continue to rise across Canada, but rural communities face
higher barriers due to limited local services, stigma, and inconsistent access to
ongoing support. Nationally, youth mental health has measurably worsened in
recent years. Statistics Canada longitudinal data shows that about one in five youth
who felt their mental health was “good” or better in 2019 no longer felt that way in
2023, demonstrating real deterioration over time. Because of this, rural mental health
delivery is shifting toward private self-screening tools, discreet referral pathways, and
structured follow-up models that encourage continued engagement rather than
one-time crisis response. In small communities like Clearwater Ridge, concerns over
visibility and stigma can significantly reduce adoption, so solutions must be privacy-
first and low-friction. Clearwater Ridge would benefit from a mental health pathway
integrated into broader care coordination, allowing residents to access provincial
support while maintaining confidentiality and ensuring consistent follow-up.
Financials
The Clearwater Ridge Community Health Council has allocated a maximum first-year
budget of $60,000 CAD for the development and deployment of a care coordination
solution. Ongoing operating costs must remain below $25,000 per year to ensure
long-term sustainability.
Estimated cost ranges for key components include:
Software development or platform integration: $10,000–$45,000 Hardware
(tablets, devices): $500–$800 per unit
Cloud hosting, security, and maintenance: $15,000–$25,000 per year
From a system perspective, missed appointments cost an estimated $200 per
occurrence, while preventable emergency hospitalizations can cost $8,000–
$12,000 each. Emergency medical airlifts may cost approximately $15,000 per
incident.
Proposed solutions will be evaluated based on their ability to operate within budget
constraints while demonstrating clear potential to reduce high-cost emergency
events and improve care continuity. Teams are not expected to produce formal
financial statements. Instead, proposals should include a clear budget allocation, an
explanation of ongoing operating costs, and a rationale for how the solution reduces
high-cost healthcare failures.
Deliverables
Teams are required to submit both a functional prototype and a presentation that
clearly demonstrate how their solution improves one defined breakdown in care
coordination within Clearwater Ridge (e.g., referrals, follow-ups, reminders, or
transportation).
1. Technical Prototype (Required)
Teams must design and build a technical prototype that demonstrates core
functionality related to the chosen breakdown in care coordination.

Prototype Requirements:

Must be original and created by the team, and MUST be created within the 38
hour block (cannot start before the hacking start time, or you will not be
considered)

Does not need to be fully production-ready, but must go beyond static mockups

Should clearly show how the solution would be used by real users (e.g., nurses,
patients, coordinators)

Submission Format:

Submit your project through Devpost (link will be provided in Slack)
2. Presentation Deck (Required)
Teams must submit a presentation deck that explains the journey from problem
identification to solution design. In your Devpost submission, under “About the
Project”, please create a new heading titled ## Slide Deck and link your deck
there. Please make sure to make it public, or your slides may not be considered.

An example slide deck is provided on Slack to help guide your structure, level of
detail, and overall presentation style.
Presentation (Required)
On presentation day, teams will deliver:

A 7-minute presentation, including a walkthrough of the prototype

Followed by a 3-minute Q&A session

Teams should be prepared to:

Explain how their solution works in practice

Justify design and scope decisions

Discuss feasibility, scalability, and impact


Teams are not expected to solve all healthcare challenges in Clearwater Ridge;
instead, each team must select one clearly defined breakdown in care coordination
(such as referrals, follow-up, reminders, or transportation) and build a technical
solution that meaningfully improves it.
